## üéØ What is PORTX?

PORTX transforms Git for Windows into a complete, portable POSIX environment. It combines Git Bash as the trusted foundation with an architecture inspired by Cygwin and MSYS2, plus over 100+ carefully selected Windows-native command-line tools, all pre-configured to work together seamlessly. 

**PORTX = Portable + POSIX + Git Bash + 100+ Tools + Zero Hassle**

### üîß 100% Windows Native
- **No DLL dependencies** - No cygwin1.dll, no msys-2.0.dll
- **Pure Windows executables** - All tools run directly on Windows
- **No emulation layers** - Native performance, no overhead
- **No registry entries** - Completely self-contained
- **No installation required** - Just extract and run

### ‚úÖ Perfect for:
- Developers stuck on locked-down corporate Windows machines
- DevOps engineers who need real Unix tools
- Anyone who wants a consistent environment across different Windows PCs
- Teams who need to share the same toolset without installation hassles

### üì¶ What's Included:
- Full Git Bash (MinGW64) environment with all Unix commands
- **100+ additional tools** from the best open source projects
- **Industry-standard DevOps**: AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker tools
- **Modern CLI tools**: Rust-based utilities (ripgrep, bat, fd), Go tools (fzf, lazygit)
- **Security & networking**: nmap, nuclei, age encryption, SSH suite
- Best utilities cherry-picked from Cygwin, MSYS2, and GitHub releases
- Complete POSIX/Unix environment: proper home directory, .bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.
- Pre-configured portable home with SSH, Git config, custom prompt
- **Zero external dependencies** - every tool is a standalone Windows-native executable

## Why PORTX?

### The POSIX on Windows Problem

For running Linux-style tools and POSIX environments on Windows, you have limited options:

**Cygwin**
- Heavy runtime with cygwin1.dll dependency for every tool
- Tools must be compiled specifically for Cygwin
- Performance overhead from POSIX emulation layer
- Often blocked by corporate security due to DLL injection concerns
- Requires installation and registry modifications

**MSYS2**
- Better than Cygwin but still requires msys-2.0.dll
- Package management adds complexity
- Multiple subsystems (MSYS, MINGW32, MINGW64) cause confusion
- Also frequently blocked by corporate security policies
- Requires administrative privileges for proper setup

**WSL/WSL2**
- Requires Windows features and admin rights
- Virtual machine overhead
- File system performance issues
- Network complexity
- Often disabled in corporate environments

### The Git Bash Advantage

**Git for Windows (Git Bash)** is different:
- **Corporate Approved**: Almost universally accepted because it's "just Git"
- **Native Windows**: MinGW-based tools run as native Windows executables
- **No Special DLLs**: Most tools are standalone executables
- **Trusted**: Microsoft themselves bundle Git Bash with Visual Studio
- **Lightweight**: No heavy emulation layers or virtual machines

### The Remaining Problems

Even Git Bash has issues:
- Standard Git Bash uses Windows user-specific paths (`C:\Users\%USERNAME%`)
- Limited tool selection out of the box
- Tools scattered across different installers pollute your system PATH
- Configuration files get lost in user profiles
- Moving between machines means reconfiguring everything

### The PORTX Solution

PORTX solves ALL these problems:
- **Corporate Friendly**: Built on Git Bash, which security teams already trust
- **100% Windows Native**: Every tool is a native Windows executable - no DLL dependencies
- **True Portability**: Everything runs from a single directory that can be moved/copied anywhere
- **Zero Installation**: No installers, no registry modifications, no admin rights needed
- **No Emulation**: Direct Windows execution means native performance
- **Unified Environment**: All tools use the same portable home directory
- **Developer Ready**: Everything a modern developer needs, pre-configured and ready to use

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
C:\App\Git\                    # Can be placed anywhere
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-bash-portable.bat      # Launcher that sets portable environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin\                       # Core Git Bash binaries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr\                       # Unix system files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc\                       # System configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home\
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ portable\              # Portable home directory
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .bashrc            # Shell configuration (DO NOT set USER/HOME here!)
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitconfig         # Git configuration
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .ssh\              # SSH keys and config

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin-ext\                   # Additional core Unix tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin-tools\                 # Extended toolset organized by category
```

### How It Works

1. **True POSIX Environment**: Complete Unix-like file system hierarchy
   - Proper home directory with `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.gitconfig`
   - Unix-style configuration files and scripts
   - Full shell environment just like Linux/macOS

2. **Environment Override**: `portx.bat` (or `git-bash-portable.bat`) sets:
   - `HOME=/home/portable` (not user-specific)
   - `USER=portable`
   - `USERNAME=portable`

3. **Best of All Worlds**: 
   - Core system from Git Bash (trusted by corporate)
   - Architecture inspired by Cygwin and MSYS2's Unix-like hierarchy
   - Hundreds of tools from open source repositories - best in industry
   - Cherry-picked from Cygwin, MSYS2, and standalone projects
   - Industry-leading tools: Rust utilities (ripgrep, bat, delta), Go tools (lazygit, lazydocker), and more
   - But WITHOUT any DLL dependencies - everything runs as Windows-native executables

4. **Intelligent Tool Discovery**: Advanced PATH management with smart scanning
   - **Dynamic executable counting**: Real-time counts displayed as `TOOLS(122+45+118)`
   - **Scoped directory scanning**: Only searches within PORTX structure (prevents Cygwin64 pollution)
   - **Smart filtering**: Excludes temp, cache, uninstall, and setup-only directories
   - **Performance caching**: Daily cache regeneration with configurable scan depth
   - **Minimum executable threshold**: Only adds directories with sufficient tool density

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Environment Status
On startup, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ PORTX(MSYS2-MINGW64/xterm-256color) ‚úÖ TOOLS(122+45+118) ‚úÖ SSH(user@example.com)
/c/Work/Projects [main]
$
```

### 2. Custom Prompt
Two-line prompt showing:
- Current directory path
- Git branch and status (when in a repository)
- Clean command line on the second line

### 3. Status Indicators
Visual status indicators show system health at a glance:
- **‚úÖ** Green checkmark = Component working properly
- **üõë** Red stop sign = Component has issues
- **PORTX**: Environment security and compatibility
- **TOOLS**: Dynamic PATH loading with real-time executable counts (e.g., `TOOLS(122+45+118)`)
  - Shows core MinGW tools + bin-ext tools + bin-tools discoveries
  - Smart directory scanning with configurable depth and filtering
  - Cached for performance with automatic daily regeneration
- **SSH**: Agent status and loaded keys

### 4. SSH Agent Management
Automatic SSH agent startup with key loading from `~/.ssh/`

### 5. Environment Security
Detects and warns about PATH conflicts with other MSYS2/Cygwin installations

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Download**: Get PORTX and extract to any location (e.g., `C:\PORTX` or USB drive)
2. **Launch**: Run `portx.bat`
3. **Work**: All 100+ tools are immediately available in your PATH
4. **Move**: Copy the entire PORTX folder anywhere - it just works

That's it. No installation, no admin rights, no PATH pollution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never modify USER or HOME in .bashrc!** The portable functionality depends on these being set by the launcher.

To update tools:
- Git: Download new portable Git and replace core files
- Individual tools: Replace executables in `bin-ext` or `bin-tools`

## üí° Philosophy

PORTX follows the Unix philosophy:
- Each tool does one thing well
- Tools work together through standard interfaces
- Configuration is plain text
- No hidden magic or complex installers

This is not a package manager or a framework. It's a curated, pre-configured environment that just works.
